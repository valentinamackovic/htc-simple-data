; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; You've been asked to design a program having to do with all the owls
; in the owlery.
; 
; (A) Design a data definition to represent the weights of all the owls. 
;     For this problem call it ListOfNumber.
; (B) Design a function that consumes the weights of owls and produces
;     the total weight of all the owls.
; (C) Design a function that consumes the weights of owls and produces
;     the total number of owls.
;     


;; Data definitions:

;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;; interp. each number in the list is an owl weight in ounces
(define LON1 empty)
(define LON2 (cons 60 (cons 42 empty)))
#;
(define (fn-for-lon lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first lon)
              (fn-for-lon (rest lon)))]))

;; Template rules used:
;;  - one of: 2 cases
;;  - atomic distinct: empty
;;  - compound: (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;;  - self-reference: (rest lon) is ListOfNumber

;; Functions:

;; ListOfNumber -> Number
;; produce sum of weights of owls in lon
(check-expect (sum empty) 0)
(check-expect (sum (cons 20 empty)) 20)
(check-expect (sum (cons 32 (cons 20 empty))) (+ 32 20))

;(define (sum lon) 0) ;stub

(define (sum lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 0]
        [else
         (+ (first lon)          
            (sum (rest lon)))]))

;; ListOfNumber -> Number
;; produce number of owls
(check-expect (number empty) 0)
(check-expect (number (cons 20 empty)) 1)
(check-expect (number (cons 32 (cons 20 empty))) 2)

;(define (number lon) 0) ;stub

(define (number lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) 0]
        [else
         (+ 1 (number (rest lon)))]))
#;
(define (number lon)
  (length lon))
